lim $\Huge{\frac{sin\theta}{\theta}}$ = 1
$\theta$ -> 0

The way I think about it as that we are never hitting zero, a limit is something we are approaching but not hitting, and if we plug in 0.0001 and -0.0001 we get values that are close to hence and that's why when the limit approaches 0 the answer is 1

$\Huge{1 \geq \frac{sin \theta}{\theta}  \geq cos \theta}$, for $\frac{-\pi}{2}$ < $\theta$ $\frac{\pi}{2}$
