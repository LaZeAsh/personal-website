More specific than normal chemistry (no more synthesis, decomposition, etc.)

## Precipitation Reactions

Precipitate - insoluble solid that separates from solid
Refer to [[Solubility Rules]] for these types of reactions

ppt = precipitation
rxn = reaction

This is similar to double displacement reactions 

Reactions that will create precipitate (when a solid forms)

When 2 aqueous solutions of iconic compounds are mixed, an insoluble substance forms 

Pb(NO$_3$)$_2$ (aq) + 2 NaI (aq) -> PbI$_2$ (s) + 2NaNO$_3$ (aq)
[[Molecular Formula]]

Pb$^{2+}$ + 2NO$_3$ $^-$ + 2 Na$^+$ + 2I$^-$ -> PbI$_2$ (s) + 2Na$^+$ + 2NO$_3$ $^-$ 
Complete ionic equations (dissect every compound except the precipitate so everything that's aqueous) 

Pb$^{2+}$ + 2I$^-$ -> PbI$_2$ (s)
Net ionic equation

Na$^+$ and NO$_3$ $^-$ are spectator ions

## Acid-base reactions (don't do anything until Chapter 14)
