Mr.Gibbons is my [[Grade 12]] [[Physics]] teacher, like all my teachers I respect him very much. Mr.Gibbons graduated from University of California Berkeley, go bears!

## What people have told me

People say Mr.Gibbons is a hard teacher his class isn't easy and how he's a little sarcastic sometimes.

## My opinions

I like sarcasm, 1st day of class I found him to be very funny, looking at his course syllabus this class doesn't seem to be a walk in the park and I believe rather than people taking [[Self Responsibility]] they blame Mr.Gibbons for it. I will know more once I continue in his class although I think he'll be a good teacher that will teach me a lot about the subject Physics.
