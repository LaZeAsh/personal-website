Chapter 2 of the Pearson Physics textbook by James S. Walker

## Chapter 2.1

In physics a frame of reference is referred to as a coordinate system

Distance is the total length travelled and the SI unit is meter (m)

Displacement - Change in an object's position

Displacement and Distance are not the same, for example:

You could have travelled 10 miles and travelled another 10 miles back and your displacement would be 0 meanwhile your total distance travelled would be 20 miles.

That isn't to say that displacement and distance cannot be the same, if you travel 10 miles in a straight line then the total distance travelled and displacement would be the same

## Chapter 2.2

Speed describes how fast or slow something moves

Average Speed - Speed of an object defined over a given period of time

SI unit for speed: meters per second (m/s)

Average velocity is the displacement per unit of time

average velocity = $\frac{displacement}{elapsed time}$

Average velocity also indicates the direction that the object was traveling on average

Average Speed and Average Velocity are not the same

Speed:
- Rate of motion
- Always positive
- The greater the speed of an object the faster it moves

Velocity:
- Gives rate of motion and direction
- Sign of velocity indicates direction
- Magnitude of velocity is the speed of motion

## Chapter 2.4

SI unit position: m

Equation for constant velocity is a straight line
