Do 10 pushups every time you get a math problem wrong, I feel like this would be a good addition as I get quite a few math problems wrong. So if I am not pushing my brain to it's full capacity at least I am getting more fit in the process

I have already done 20 pushups so far at the time of writing this...

I am not sure what it is but even tho I am not tired after doing 20 pushups whenever I try to do more it hurts, I think this is something that i'll get over overtime
