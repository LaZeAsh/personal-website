These are the solubility rules for AP Chemistry

Ionic compounds containing any of the following ions are always soluble in water
- Sodium ion, Na$^+$
- Potassium ion, K$^+$
- Ammonium ion, NH$_4$ $^+$
- Nitrate ion, NO$_3$ $^-$

In a double displacement reaction a product will contain at least one of the ions above, the product is soluble so the other is insoluble (the precipitate) 

Other words: Just look for these and if the compound includes these then soluble if not then it's insoluble
