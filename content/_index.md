## My Mind üß†

I started taking notes on [[Obsidian]] on October 15, 2022 

The goal of publicizing these notes is to give the world a look into my experiences while also keeping me accountable to have my notes follow a certain quality or standard. For more information check out [[Why I started writing notes]]

Browse My Mind:

- Use the search bar on the top right of the page to look for my opinions or knowledge on a specific topic
- At the time of writing this my notes are very disorganized and follow no particular pattern, I aim to improve this in the future
- If you would like to learn more about me and view some of my "formal" writing check out my [blog](https://medium.com/@ayushrgarg)

‚ö†Ô∏è By no means are my notes perfect, I learn differently and view things differently than other people and therefore I recommend you take what you see with a [[Grain of salt |grain of salt]]
