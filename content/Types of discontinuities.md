Continuous if:
- if f(x) exists
- if lim x$^-$ and lim x$^+$ exists
## Point / Removable

Limit @ x = 3 exists; although not continuous

## Jump Discontinuity

Left and right side limits @ x = 2 exists; but the limit @ x = 2 does not exist

## Asymptotic Discontinuity


Left and right side limit @ x = 2 doesn't exist
