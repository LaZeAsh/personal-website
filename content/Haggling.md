Haggle - Dispute or bargain persistently, especially over the cost of something

## Why I think Haggling is stupid

For big items (like a car) unless you are haggling over ~1k+ I believe it's not worth it. Of course it also depends on the overall price of the car but for most cars I feel like haggling over < 1,000 dollars isn't worth it.

1. Spend time looking for another buyer (if one's even going to approach you)
2. Show off the car to them by taking time out of your day
3. Haggle with them which sucks
4. Finally exchange money for the title and keys

This might be worth it if your time isn't worth anything but in my opinion the time and convenience isn't worth it. I might also be whining because I was about to buy a 2000 Mazda Miata NB1 and the deal fell through because of a haggle war over $500 USD.

Oh beautiful Mazda Miata, I really liked this car. It drove well, it was local, the dude selling it was nice, and most important of all it's a MANUAL

Now that I have told you why Haggling is stupid it'd only be right for me to teach you how to haggle
