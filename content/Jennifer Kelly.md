Ms.Kelly is my [[Grade 12]] [[AP Calculus BC]] teacher, like all my teachers I respect her very much.

## What people have told me

People said that she's pretty strict, although I think this may be because of the tough courseload and little to do with her character

## What I think

Ms.Kelly seems to be very passionate about what she does, and so far she seems like a reasonable human being. I am not sure if I made the best first impression but she is someone who I think can help me set a good foundation for Calculus and I am grateful to have her as a teacher. I am starting to notice a pattern all the rigorous courses are the ones where the teachers are "hated" the most.
