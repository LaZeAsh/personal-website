## Homework
Get your stuff printed
*Box your answers*
## Hints
V = $\Huge{\frac{\delta d}{\delta t}}$ = $\Huge{\frac{cm}{sec}}$ = answer $\Huge{\frac{cm}{sec}}$ 
Conversion sheet will be on the test

Sometimes [[Christopher Gibbons|Mr.Gibbons]] drops hints before the unit test and I am going to write them here so I can review them the night before

- On the Unit 1 test we're going to be given the graph of velocity and told to draw the graph of displacement and velocity using the graph of velocity
- Unit conversion might be density
	- Pay attention to the units on the unit test
- Graph on the test where we will have to find slope
- Precision and Accuracy on the test
- Difference between scalar & vector (1st couple unit tests)
- What's a hypothesis
- Most of physics stuff is from the summary page on the kinematics note
- Look at kinematics notes study that for the unit test
- "Read the graph"


Unit 3 - 4 part calculation (if done without then you will get 1 point)
